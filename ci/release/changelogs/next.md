#### Features 🚀

- exports: render PNG, GIF, PDF, and PPTX with the built-in renderer

#### Improvements 🧹

- performance: SVG rendering is approximately 10× faster across the E2E corpus. Real-world diagrams compile, lay out, and render approximately 3× faster at the median.
- renders: SVG exports are approximately 24% smaller across the E2E corpus and 18% smaller across real-world fixtures, with unchanged appearance.
- renders: render Markdown labels as native SVG instead of HTML `foreignObject` content

#### Bugfixes ⛑️

- sequence diagrams: keep synthetic lifeline endpoint IDs stable across architectures
- exports: honor `D2_TIMEOUT` during PNG and GIF rendering
- compiler: keep recursive globs out of class and variable definitions and report class reference cycles instead of overflowing the stack
- renders: decode gzip, Brotli, and deflate remote images before embedding them
